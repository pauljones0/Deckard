"""Settings-JSON ratchet. No module opens a settings file with a bare json.load.

Run it the same way CI does, from anywhere:

    python scripts/check_settings_json.py

Exit 0 means every json.load and json.dump call in the governed trees sits in a
file that the allowlist below sanctions. Exit 1 prints one message per problem
and names the fix. The --self-test flag runs the check against a throwaway tree
with a planted bare reader and proves it goes red. It prints PASS or FAIL and
is not part of the ordinary run.

The app owns a set of JSON settings files. They are the deck settings, the app
settings, the page-manager bookkeeping, the asset library index, the plugin
settings, and the UI state of the asset chooser. Each one needs the same three
answers. Where does it live, what happens when it is corrupt, and who may write
it. src/backend/settings_store.py holds those answers, and a surface gets them
by reading and writing through the store. A module that opens one of these
files with a bare json.load gets none of them. It does not heal a corrupt file,
and one such reader took the whole app down at boot. It shares no cache with
the other readers. Its write can land past the atomic writer.

This check makes a raw reader a decision. A json.load in a file that the
allowlist does not name fails the build, so a reviewer sees the choice between
a route through the store and a sanctioned exception, in a two-line diff.

This check does not police json.loads and json.dumps. Those parse an in-memory
string, such as the stdout of a subprocess, a DBus reply or an HTTP body, and
they never touch a settings file. A check on them would make every
window-grabber integration and every store payload a false positive. A settings
file is opened and then read or written, which is json.load and json.dump, and
the store draws the same line.

The rules are these.

Every json.load and json.dump call in a governed file must sit in a file that
ALLOWLIST names. A call anywhere else fails.

The allowlist works per file, so an entry sanctions the raw JSON access in that
file. A file that the allowlist names and that makes no such call fails too. A
standing exemption for a read that nobody performs is how the next one arrives
unremarked, so the exemption goes when its reader goes.

from json import load and from json import dump fail. They bind the file entry
points under bare names that this check cannot see at the call site, which is
the one way a governed reader hides from it. Write json.load instead, or, for a
settings file, go through the store.

A call is any <json>.load(...) or <json>.dump(...) where <json> is the name json
or a module alias that import json as ... binds. The walk collects them over the
whole file at any nesting depth, because main.py imports json inside the
function that uses it. The threat model is the well-meaning change. A raw reader
arrives because somebody reached for json.load, and every arrival in this tree
took that form. An alias laundered through another name, and getattr(json,
"load"), go to review, which is the line the gl-slot freeze draws too.

A guard that fails open reads as green and covers nothing, so this check also
fails when its own footing moves. Each of these is a loud failure that names the
fix, and never a silent skip: a governed root that is not a directory, a missing
governed file, a symlinked directory under a root, because the walk does not
descend into one and every call inside it would go unseen, a file that does not
parse, and an allowlist entry that names a file which does not exist or which
sits outside the governed set.

The trees are src/ and GtkHelper/, which match mypy and the module-size ratchet.
globals.py and main.py are governed by name as well, the way the gl-slot freeze
names main.py, because the allowlist sanctions a raw read in each, and an
allowlist entry that the walk never visits sanctions nothing.

This module imports from the standard library only, because it runs in the bare
python:3.13-slim image of CI beside compileall, with nothing installed.
