"""Module-size ratchet. It caps how large a module in src/ or GtkHelper/ grows.

Run it the same way CI does, from anywhere:

    python scripts/check_module_sizes.py

Exit 0 means every module is within its cap. Exit 1 prints one message per
offending file and names the fix.

A module that nobody can hold in their head stops getting a proper review and
starts to collect behaviour that belongs elsewhere. The deck controller passed
seven thousand lines that way, one convenient addition at a time, and the split
was expensive. This check makes growth past a cap a visible edit to this file,
not a line that a diff hides.

The rules are these.

Every .py file under src/ and GtkHelper/ takes a cap of DEFAULT_CAP physical
lines.

GRANDFATHER lists the files that were already over that cap when this guard
landed, each pinned at the size it had that day. Such a file may shrink and
nothing else, and one line of growth fails the build.

A GRANDFATHER cap tightens by itself. When a listed file drops more than
TIGHTEN_SLACK lines below its cap, the check fails and asks for a cap at the
new size. A refactor therefore cannot bank headroom for later growth. When a
listed file falls to DEFAULT_CAP or below, its entry goes away and the default
cap governs.

The deck controller shim takes a separate hard cap of SHIM_CAP lines. It holds
only re-exports, which are import statements and __all__, and the cap stops code
from collecting on the old path and undoing the package split.

A guard that fails open reads as green and covers nothing, so this check also
fails when its own footing moves. Each of these is a loud failure that names the
fix, and never a silent skip: a root in ROOTS that is not a directory, a
GRANDFATHER entry that names a file which does not exist or which sits outside
the roots, a missing shim, and a symlinked directory under a root, because the
walk does not descend into one and its contents would go uncapped.

The roots are src/ and GtkHelper/. The type checker covers more than that: its
include set also names locales/ and the root-level modules, such as main.py and
globals.py. Those stay ungoverned by the cap. They are small and few. Widen the
roots when that stops being true.

To lower a GRANDFATHER number, or to delete an entry that the check calls
obsolete, edit the table in the commit that shrinks the file. To raise a number,
or to add an entry, is a decision to let a module keep growing, and the split it
needs instead is almost always the cheaper change.

This check counts physical lines the way an editor shows them, which is every
newline plus a final line without a terminator. A file whose last line has no
terminator therefore reads one higher here than in wc -l.

This module imports from the standard library only, because it runs in the bare
python:3.13-slim image of CI beside compileall, with nothing installed.
