"""Slot freeze for globals.py. The gl inventory must not grow unnoticed.

Run it the same way CI does, from anywhere:

    python scripts/check_gl_slots.py

Exit 0 means globals.py declares exactly the names the tables below list, and
every gl.<name> = ... in the governed trees targets a declared slot. Exit 1
prints one message per problem and names the fix.

Every part of the app imports globals, so any module can mint a process-wide
slot with one assignment and nothing reports it. Such a slot is an implicit
dependency edge that no reader sees, no rename follows, and no test stubs.
This check does not shrink the inventory and does not stop an addition. It
makes an addition two edits in one diff, with a reviewer present.

A new service needs no slot. Build it as a local in main.create_global_objects
and pass it to whatever needs it, the way the page manager backend takes the
settings manager as a constructor argument. The dependency then appears in a
signature, where a reader finds it, a rename follows it, and a test substitutes
it. A slot is for state with no owner.

The declaration pin. The set of names globals.py binds at module scope must
equal FROZEN_SLOTS plus INCIDENTAL plus IMPORTED plus MACHINERY, exactly. Both
directions fail. A new declaration fails until a table lists it, and a table
entry whose declaration is gone fails until the entry goes too.

The assignment pin. In every governed file, each attribute store on the module
alias must name a FROZEN_SLOTS entry. That covers gl.X = ..., the augmented
form, for gl.X in ..., and with ... as gl.X. A store to an IMPORTED, INCIDENTAL
or MACHINERY name fails too, because those names are not API. The one exception
is MODULE_TYPE_STORES, granted per file and per attribute, for a store that
reaches the machinery of the module object rather than its inventory.

setattr(gl, ...) and delattr(gl, ...) fail, because a computed slot name is
invisible to this check. del gl.X fails too, because it makes the frozen
inventory false at runtime.

This check does not police attribute reads. What may be read from gl, and by
which layer, is a separate question with a separate guard.

This check does not police a change to the contents of a slot, such as
gl.loggers[...] = ... or an append to a queue. Those are the semantics of those
slots. gl.__dict__[...] = ... reaches the module namespace, but it is a
subscript store as well, and this check does not see it. Nothing in the tree
writes that way.

A declaration is a target of an assignment, an annotated assignment, an
augmented assignment, a for, a with ... as, a walrus, or a type alias, plus an
import and a module-scope def or class name. The walk collects them over the
module body at any nesting depth, and it stops at a function, class or lambda
body, because a name bound in there is a local. It still walks the parts of a
def that evaluate where the def sits, which are the decorators, the default
arguments, the annotations and the base classes, because a walrus in one of
them binds module scope. It subtracts the names that a module-scope del
removes, which is why the version-reading helper that globals.py deletes after
use is in no table. It does not collect an except ... as name, because Python
deletes the handler name when the handler exits.

fallback_font has no name in the source. The module __getattr__ of globals.py
resolves it on the first read and caches it with
globals()["fallback_font"] = value. The walk collects a write into the
namespace dict under a literal key, so that slot is pinned in both directions.
A deleted caching line fails the check until the table entry goes too.

A guard that fails open reads as green and covers nothing, so this check also
fails when its own footing moves. Each of these is a loud failure that names
the fix, and never a silent skip: a missing or empty globals.py, a governed
root that is not a directory, a governed file that is not a file, a symlinked
directory under a root, because the walk does not descend into one and every
store inside it would go unseen, a file that does not parse, a name in two
tables at once, and an import statement that names globals and that this check
cannot resolve to an alias.

This check does not see the module reached without an import statement, such as
importlib.import_module("globals"), __import__("globals") or
sys.modules["globals"]. It does not see an alias laundered through another
name, such as x = gl, vars(gl), or a helper that takes the module as a
parameter. The threat model is the well-meaning change. Every slot that arrived
in this tree arrived as a plain gl.name = value. A check that chased every
indirection would approximate the interpreter and would still lose. This one
makes the ordinary path visible and leaves the rare ones to review.

This check also does not see what a class installed through a
MODULE_TYPE_STORES exemption then does. A swapped __class__ decides how every
read of the module behaves, and a __getattr__ on it that caches its answer into
the module namespace mints a name that outlives the restore. That is why the
exemption names one file and one attribute at a time, and why review grants it
to a class somebody read, not to a shape.

This module imports from the standard library only, because it runs in the bare
python:3.13-slim image of CI beside compileall, with nothing installed.
