// Release config for the bump-labeled-MR release bot (see the `.release` jobs
// in .gitlab-ci.yml). The fork's release version is the root
// VERSION file — deliberately NOT globals.py's app_version, which stays
// aligned to upstream because plugins gate on it for compatibility checks.
// VERSION is unused by the app itself (the StoreBackend VERSION lookups read
// per-plugin files inside cloned store repos), so the fork claims it.
