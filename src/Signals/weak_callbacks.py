CallbackRegistry is a locked holder for callback subscriptions. See
docs/memory-footprint-plan.md.

The registry stores a bound method as a weakref.WeakMethod, so the teardown
of an action or a controller drops its callback silently. A function, a
lambda and a functools.partial have no owner to weak-ref, so the registry
stores them strong. A lambda that captures an action therefore keeps that
action alive until an explicit remove() or disconnect().

Set SC_STRONG_CALLBACKS=1 in the environment (read once at import) to store
every callback strong. This isolates a plugin regression to this file.
