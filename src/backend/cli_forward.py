"""The CLI half of the control plane. This decides what an invocation that
carries --change-page or --change-state does with the requests it was given.

An invocation that names a deck has two jobs, by whether Deckard already runs.
With nothing running, and with --close-running, which is about to stop what
runs, the invocation becomes the instance. It parks its requests for the deck
that has not enumerated yet and boots; see legs B and C in
src/backend/startup_queue.py. With an instance running, the requests go over
the bus to that instance and this process ends.

Parking happens before the process knows which of the two it is. A launch
that parks and then loses the race for the application name holds requests
that belong to another process. forward_parked_requests takes them there.

Nothing can import main.py, because its module body re-execs the process, so
this work lives here where a scenario drives it.
