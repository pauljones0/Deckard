    A watch on the active window costs real work. The X11 and KDE
    integrations poll their helper binary five subprocesses at a time every
    200 ms, and the Sway one runs swaymsg as often. The watch helps only while
    some page carries an enabled window auto-change rule, so a rule gates it.
    The watcher starts with the first rule and stops with the last one. A
    session that never uses the feature polls no windows at all.

    The integration builds on first use, not in the constructor, because it
    costs a helper-binary probe or a D-Bus proxy. A one-shot window query must
    also work while the watcher is off, because the user reaches the page
    editor's matching-window list before the first rule exists.

    A gate pass therefore blocks on subprocess probes, on a synchronous D-Bus
    proxy build, and on a watcher join, and the GTK main thread is one of its
    callers. Every gate pass runs on the background pool, one at a time.
    refresh_watch_state only records that a re-check is due, and one worker
    drains those requests. The state settles rather than updates at once. A
