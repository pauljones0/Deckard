Log redaction. This scrubs PII from every log record before a sink sees it,
so a user shares logs.log without leaking a username, a home directory
layout, or a credential inside a url, a query parameter, an Authorization
header, or a settings or header dict.

This installs a core-level loguru patcher rather than a per-sink wrapper.
Logger._log applies core.patcher to the record before it fans out to
handler.emit (loguru 0.7 _logger.py), so one install covers every sink that
config_logger() adds, which are logs/logs.log, stderr, the gl.logs ring
behind the About dialog and the enqueued plugins.log sink, and it keeps
covering them across a log.remove() and log.add() cycle. A wrapper around the
file sink instead loses loguru's path-sink rotation, because a callable sink
does not rotate, and every sink needs its own wrapper.

A patcher cannot scrub {exception}. Each sink formats the raw (type, value,
tb) tuple itself at emit time, and a traceback frame path is the main leak,
because the central exception hooks route a full traceback into logs.log. So
for a record that carries an exception, redact_record() formats the traceback
itself with the stdlib, including a chained one, scrubs it, folds it into the
message, and clears record["exception"], so no sink formats the raw frames.
That has one side effect. The diagnose=True local-variable dumps of loguru
stop reaching the sinks, and a variable value is the worst PII in a shareable
log.

log_hooks.install_exception_hooks() calls install_log_redaction(). The hooks
route a full traceback into the sinks, so they must never fire without the
scrubbing layer. main()'s boot path gets redaction through that call, and
scenario_log_redaction asserts the pairing, because it installs the hooks
alone, so a removal of the call fails the harness.

What this redacts and what it keeps. scrub() is pure and stdlib-only, so a
unit test runs it without loguru, and every pattern compiles once at import.

The home directory, in its expanduser, realpath and $HOME spellings, becomes
"~". A guard on both sides keeps /home/nazareth, /var/home/naz and
/home/naz.old whole. A path stays readable, so /home/x/dev/App/src/y.py
becomes ~/dev/App/src/y.py.

The username, as a path segment such as /run/media/<user>/.., which includes
a dot-suffix form such as /home/<user>.old, and as the user part of
user@host. Never as a bare word, so a common-word username leaves ordinary
prose whole.

A url credential. scheme://user:pass@host and scheme://user@host become
scheme://***@host, and the host and the path stay, so a store-fetch url stays
readable.

A secret assignment, and a dict, JSON or YAML field, for an unambiguous key
vocabulary of token, access_token, api_key, password, secret and the like.
token=v, token = v, token: v, 'token': 'v' and "token": "v" all lose the
value. An ambiguous name, which is key=, sig= or auth=, redacts in url-query
position alone, anchored to a ? or an &. "key" is deck vocabulary here, so
key=3 and {'key': 3} stay whole.

An Authorization header. That covers Authorization: Basic <b64>, where Basic
decodes straight to user:pass, Bearer <token> in any case, a quoted JSON
header dump, and a raw Authorization: <value> form.

Like log_hooks, this module imports stdlib and loguru only, and it imports
loguru inside install_log_redaction() alone. It imports nothing from src/ or
globals.py, so it stays importable before globals, which the fixtures.py
contract needs, and importable by log_hooks without weakening the import
contract of log_hooks.
