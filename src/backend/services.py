"""Typed accessors for the process-wide services that live on globals.

The gl module is a namespace of late-initialised slots, and well over six
hundred places read the hottest of them, which are the locale manager, the
App, the settings manager, the deck manager and the page manager backend. Each raw read is
an invisible dependency edge. An accessor is checked once and hands its
callers a concrete type, holds the None guard in one place, gives a seam a
test can substitute, and leaves an import edge that a rename follows.

It is no service locator, no registry and no container. Nothing registers here
and nothing is constructed here. Every function reads the same slot the raw
expression reads, on every call, so a slot rebound underneath it, which the
test harness does, still applies.

def tr(key: str, fallback: str | None = None) -> str:

    This forwards to gl.lm.get, whose resolution order differs from what the
    parameter name suggests. It reads the active language, then the fallback
    locale, which defaults to the key itself, and only a value still None
    after that reaches fallback. So fallback does not answer an unknown key,
    and tr("missing", "FB") returns "missing" and not "FB". The result is
    HTML-escaped for GTK markup.

    No fallback and a fallback of None mean the same thing to the locale
    manager, so this hands the call over in two shapes rather than forward a
    None that the parameter is not typed to take.

    key is typed str and this guards it in no way. get resolves a None key to
    None, and that None comes back out through the "-> str". mypy rejects it
    at every annotated call site, so it can arrive from an unchecked one
    alone. The Store badge rows record that shape in a comment and return
    early rather than depend on it.

    Raises RuntimeError before main.create_global_objects() builds the locale
