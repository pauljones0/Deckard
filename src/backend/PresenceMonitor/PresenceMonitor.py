"""Quiescence and presence signal.

One process-wide object (gl.presence_monitor) answers one question for every
deck's media loop. Is the user away? When it answers yes,
DeckController.animations_gated() turns true and the media loop skips its
whole animation section. No background-video decode, no key, dial or
touchscreen tick, and no scroll-label advance. The control queue and the
queued interactive paints keep running at full speed.

Three inputs drive it, and every one is event-driven. Nothing polls. The
screen lock arrives at on_lock_changed, the logind idle state at
on_idle_hint_changed, and a deck press at notify_activity. Every input change
evaluates this rule.

    quiescent := mode == "system-idle" and (
        (screen_locked and now - last_deck_activity >= DECK_ACTIVITY_GRACE_S)
        or (idle_hint and now - max(idle_since, last_deck_activity) >= minutes*60)
    )

The default mode "screensaver" makes this object report False forever, which
matches the behaviour of an app without this monitor.

Those inputs arrive on three threads, which are the GLib default main context
for a Gio callback, a timer_wheel dispatch thread for the idle deadline, and a
deck reader thread for notify_activity. This module makes no GTK call.
