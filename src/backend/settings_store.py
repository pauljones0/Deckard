"""One owner for the app's settings files.

A settings surface is a JSON file the app owns. The deck settings under
settings/decks/, the asset library index, the app settings, the page manager's
bookkeeping and a plugin's settings file are all surfaces. Each one needs the
same three answers. Where does it live, what happens when it is corrupt, and
who may write it. SurfaceSpec, load_file and save_file below hold those
answers.

A settings file holds what the user chose, and the schema supplies the rest at
read time. SchemaView applies those defaults; its docstring says why a read
must never write one back.

This module imports stdlib, globals, the atomic writer and the logger, and no
toolkit, so any layer can import it.
