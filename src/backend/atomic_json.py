    A loader calls this immediately after it quarantines a file, never as a
    startup-wide filesystem walk. The scope is one primary file's own
    sidecars, so how often that file corrupts bounds the work. Only names the
    quarantine primitive writes count: <name>.corrupt, and <name>.corrupt.<n>
    with a purely numeric suffix. A user's own settings.json.corrupt.bak, and
    a directory of a matching name, stay. A user file named exactly
    <name>.corrupt reads as a sidecar and is prunable. Only this module writes
    that name next to a config file, so this documents the case instead of
    defending against it.

    protect names sidecars that survive whatever their age. Pass the sidecar
    the caller just created. Age is the sidecar's mtime, which os.replace
    carries over from the corrupt primary. That is the time the corrupt
    content was written, and not the time the sidecar appeared. A backup tool
    that restores a corrupt primary keeps its old mtime. The fresh forensic
    copy then sorts older than the sidecars already on disk, and prunes first
    without protect. A protected entry still counts toward keep, so the
    surviving total holds and the next-oldest unprotected sidecar goes
    instead.

    Names hold no age order. quarantine_corrupt_file takes the first free slot,
    so the next corruption recycles a pruned .corrupt. The name breaks a tie
    between equal mtimes only, and on a coarse-granularity filesystem that
    tie-break can invert the true age. It gives determinism within one mtime.
