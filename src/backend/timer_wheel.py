# One daemon scheduler thread for the ported delays: the screensaver reset per
# keypress, the overlay hide, and the key-hold delay. A min-heap and a
# Condition keep exactly one thread asleep, whatever the number of outstanding
# delays.
#
# The handles match threading.Timer, so a cancel-and-recreate call site needs
# only an import change:
#   - schedule(delay_s, callback) arms at once and returns a handle.
#   - handle.cancel() is idempotent and safe after the callback fired. It
#     cannot un-fire the callback, the same as Timer.cancel().
#
# The scheduler thread pops due handles and hands them off. It never runs a
# callback inline, because a callback is expensive. ScreenSaver.show() hashes
# the source file and can open a video capture before it takes a lock, and an
# inline run delays every other pending timer in the process. Each fire gets
# its own short-lived daemon thread, not main_loop's shared @background pool.
# That pool holds 8 workers for I/O-bound plugin and asset work, and these
# fires would contend with it. A fire here is rare (one reset per keypress,
# one overlay hide, one hold timer), so a fresh daemon thread per fire is
# cheap. It also keeps this module on stdlib and loguru, with no GLib, which
# the headless test harness needs.
