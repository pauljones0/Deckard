Observer dispatch for EventHolder and for the AssetManager plugin-settings
Observer, with one lane per event source.

A new asyncio event loop per trigger, and the default executor it creates,
churn file descriptors and threads. AudioControl fires its PulseEvent holder
tens of times per second during a volume change, which makes that churn visible
in telemetry. See docs/memory-footprint-plan.md. Instead, a trigger hands its
batch of observers to a background thread that keeps one loop alive across
events. Lane below states what a lane isolates, and shutdown() states what quit
does to a queue.

Ordering. Batches run FIFO inside a lane. The observers of a batch run in
registration order, one at a time, each in its own try and except, so one
failing observer never stops the rest. The observers of one holder share its
lane, so one that blocks still delays that event source's other observers. A
split of a batch across lanes would lose the registration-order FIFO that
plugins depend on, which tests/scenario_event_dispatch_contract.py pins.
Nothing is ordered across lanes, because dispatch is a queue-and-return from
arbitrary plugin threads.

trigger_event() and notify() return as soon as the batch is queued, before the
observers run. That already holds for the call site that matters.
PulseEvent.trigger_event() runs synchronously inside the dispatch loop of
pulse.event_listen(), and nothing reads a return value or waits for the
observers.

Known limitation. A lane's loop identity changes across an idle reap, so an
observer that captured its running loop for a later call_soon_threadsafe holds
a closed one. No installed plugin does that, and AudioControl is the only
producer of async observers.
