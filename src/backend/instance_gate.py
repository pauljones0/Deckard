"""Uniqueness, decided once, before this launch does anything exclusive.

Nothing can import main.py. Its module body re-execs the process and runs
the rename migration against the real user directories. A uniqueness
decision that lives there is therefore untestable. main.py keeps the argv
read, the wiring and the exit. The decision lives here, where a scenario
drives it against a real bus daemon, and establish() states the order it
decides in.

Why nothing here claims the name first

A claim on the application name up front, before the expensive work, settles a
race earlier, and this module does not take that shape. A connection that owns
the application name makes GApplication's own register() find the name taken.
Then register() demotes the process that holds it to a remote instance. A
pre-claim therefore defeats the mechanism it means to help. A claim on a
different name works, and that is the second owner of uniqueness this module
replaced. It meant two names to keep in step, and a winner that held one of
them while the other stayed unowned for a whole boot. What stays is an ask rather than a
claim. A NameHasOwner probe and a release poll own nothing, which leaves
register() as the one claim in the tree and its verdict as the only one.

The upgrade window

A build that predates this ordering owns nothing until its main loop starts,
so a launch of this build that lands while such a build still boots sees an
unowned name and becomes the primary. Two primaries then run on one machine
for a moment. It needs a version change and a launch inside one boot window,
and the next start of either build ends it.
