"""The port from the engine to the UI.

The render engine (src/backend/DeckManagement) must not know that a GTK window
exists. That means no widget imports, no gl.app.main_win reads, and no GTK
state read from the media thread. Everything the engine tells a UI goes
through the small synchronous interface below, which the attached UI
implements.

The base class is the null implementation. With no UI attached every method
does nothing and push_input_image returns False, which is the headless
behaviour. The engine then dirty-marks, and the UI recomposites on map.

The pull direction stays outside this port. On map, KeyGrid and
ScreenBar.load_from_changes call controller.get_input(...).get_current_image()
themselves. A UI that reads pure engine state is legal in-process, and it has
the shape a later "recomposite request" IPC message takes.

This module imports only the standard library, so any engine module can use it
without a UI dependency cycle.
