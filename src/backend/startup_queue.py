"""Boot-phase deferral for work asked of something that does not exist yet.

This module owns two handshakes for the whole process. Leg A defers a call
until the App runs, and App.on_activate drains it. Legs B and C park a CLI
request, named by deck serial, until that deck appears, and the controller for
the serial claims it on its first default-page load.

This module imports globals and nothing else first-party, so any layer,
including the render engine's import closure, imports it without a cycle.
