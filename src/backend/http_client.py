The shared HTTP client is one process-wide requests.Session behind a retrying
adapter. Every outbound fetch uses it, which covers the store catalog, the
install archives, the asset URL imports, and the contributor list of the About
dialog.

The session gives connection reuse. A store page load issues about 150 small
requests to raw.githubusercontent.com. The top-level requests.get() builds a
throwaway Session per call, which costs a fresh TCP and TLS handshake per
fetch. A pooled Session spreads one handshake across the catalog load.

The session also holds the one retry policy. GitHub rate-limits by IP with a
429, and the store answers that with the stale-cache fallback in
StoreBackend.get_remote_file.

This module builds the session once and never mutates it, so the store
prepare pool, the UI install threads and the asset-manager worker thread can
share it. The connection pools of urllib3 and the cookie jar of requests are
each thread-safe; a concurrent reconfiguration of a Session is not.

    The retry policy is 2 retries (3 attempts) on 429, 502 and 503, with a
    0.5s backoff factor, and it obeys a server-sent Retry-After. raise_on_status
    stays off, so an exhausted retry budget returns the final response instead
    of raising. Each call site then keeps its own status handling, and the
    store keeps its stale-cache fallback.

    connect=0 takes connect errors out of the budget that total covers. This
    policy retries a status. A retry of a failed CONNECT gains nothing,
    because a black-holed or down host stays down for those seconds. It also
    costs three times the wall clock on every offline failure, so a 10s asset
    download becomes a 31s block. KeyGrid's GTK drop handler calls
    HelperMethods.download_file synchronously on the main thread. Read errors
    stay retryable, because those are transient.
