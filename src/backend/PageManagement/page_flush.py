"""
The page-flush seam is the one place that turns a Page's in-memory dict into
the bytes in pages/<name>.json, and the one place that decides when. An inline
write in each mutator asks that question at about 30 call sites. Each one
answers "now, twice per keystroke, on the GTK main thread".

What this module owns

* the canonical key a page file is known by in this process (canonical_path),
* the per-file save lock registry (save_lock),
* a per-file record of who holds edits the file does not have (_pending),
* the timer that turns a burst of edits into one write (mark_dirty), and
* which page files this process copied into pages/backups/ (_backed_up).

The protocol, in four calls

mark_dirty(source) records that the content of source is ahead of its file, and
arms the write. flush_path(path) brings the file level now. flush_all() does
the same for every path with something outstanding. discard_path(path) throws
pending edits away, which a page deletion needs.

The read barrier

Anything that reads a page file from disk must call flush_path or flush_all
first, or it reads the file instead of the page. The barriers are at the page
manager's get_page_data, the asset sweep's per-file read, the page export, the
duplicate's read-back, the page move's copy, the boot backup zip and the video
cache sweep. The importers call discard_path instead, because they overwrite
the page wholesale. That list is the reader map, and it is a precondition for
any deferral.

Every call works from any thread. A save starts on the GTK main thread, on a
plugin or action thread, or on an ad-hoc thread. The lock rules live at
save_lock and at _pending_guard.
