"""
One page file, one dict, one lock.

Many decks can show one page json, and each deck holds its own Page object for
it. A PageDocument holds that content once, so an edit through one Page is an
edit for all of them, with no file involved.

The page manager owns the registry that hands documents out. It keys them
through the flush seam's canonical_path, so a page named two ways is one
document with one save lock and one pending write. A document is minted on
first use and never dropped, and each one holds a whole page dict, tens of
kilobytes. Only the registry can promise one content per file. An entry dropped
while a Page still reads through it gives the next Page a second copy, silently.

edit() is the mutation seam for everything that is not a Page. That covers the
page settings, the whole-file editor, and the sweep that strips a deleted asset
out of every page. The lock rules live at edit() and at adopt(), and the refresh
rules at refresh_from_disk() and _apply().

Page delegates four names here: the json-shaped snapshot, the removal of live
action objects, the key ordering, and the copy into pages/backups/. All four
belong to the content and its path, and the seam needs them for a page no deck
shows.
