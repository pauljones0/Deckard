"""
Which cached pages the cache must not tear down.

Eviction is an in-memory teardown. It destroys the page's action objects and
pops its cache slot. A holder of an evicted page then drives dead objects. The
next fetch for the same (controller, path) mints a second Page. One key then
carries two sets of action objects that register live event handlers. The cache
sees two holders by itself: a controller's active_page and its
screensaver-pending page. A pin is how every other holder says so. It is a
count of the holders that a teardown breaks.

The count is kept per Page object, not per (controller, path) key, because the
release must name what the acquire named. A path can be renamed under a holder,
and a cache entry can be replaced. There is one Page per (controller, path), so
the keyspace stays the cache's own.

There are two kinds of holder. holding() and bracket() below serve bracketed
work, and reserve_fetch() serves the one outstanding fetch of a deck. Each of
those states its own release rule. The lock rules live at PagePins.
