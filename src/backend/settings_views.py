"""The typed views over the settings surfaces.

A SchemaView is a settings dict read through its schema. An absent key reads
as the schema's default. A write of an unknown key raises. The storage stays
sparse, so a load path persists no default. DeckSettings, AppSettings
and PluginSettings build on it and add the named accessors and the envelope
handling for one surface each.

Why this module exists

These views belong next to the surfaces they read, in settings_store, because
they describe the same files. They sit in their own module because the store
and its views together grew past a reviewable size, and they split cleanly.
The views depend on the store, on the surface specs and the get() singleton,
and the store does not depend on them at import time. settings_store
re-imports these four names at the foot of its own body, so every external
importer still reaches AppSettings, DeckSettings, PluginSettings and
SchemaView at settings_store. This module is the store's back half, and no
second entry point, so nothing imports it directly.

    This wraps a mapping that somebody already read, and copies nothing, so a

    becomes a persisted key on the next save (see the module docstring). A

    A view is one read. Build it once at the top of a load path and

    What a read hands back

    A stored value comes back as a copy here, which matches the surfaces whose
    store reads are copies. The caller mutates what it got and saves it back,
    and two callers must not reach each other's half-made edits. An aliasing
    view, with shared=True, hands the stored value back by reference, because
    it reads one object that every holder writes into (see AppSettings). The
    sharing must hold at every level. A view that handed out the top dict by
    reference and a list inside it by copy would take
    view.custom_stores.append(x), and a save would persist nothing.

    A default comes back as a copy either way. Nothing stored exists to alias,
    and a hand-out of the schema's own container lets one holder corrupt every
    later reader of that key.
