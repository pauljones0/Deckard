The byte-capped LRU shared by both native-image caches.

EncodedImageCache (pixel-hash keys plus a doorkeeper) and NativeTileCache
(frame-identity keys plus a kill switch) need the same OrderedDict-as-LRU and
the same byte accounting. This module holds that core once. The subclasses
supply only their admission policy and their teardown bookkeeping.

The paint path runs on the sole device writer's thread, which is why this
class has this shape. Its cost there:

    get() hit   one dict lookup, one move_to_end, one float store.
    put()       the same, plus the local-cap eviction loop, plus one
                Event.set() per about 1 MiB admitted (see cache_budget's
                wake damping). Nothing outside this instance's lock.
    eviction    popitem scale, one lock, never nested with another.

Instances also implement cache_budget.BudgetParticipant, through the budget_
methods at the foot of the class.
