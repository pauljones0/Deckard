"""Shared build, promote and decode-ahead discipline for video-backed tile
caches.

Mp4FrameCache decodes the source video once, through a cv2.VideoWriter mp4v
encode that os.replace promotes atomically. Every frame after that is a cheap
decode out of the small canvas or tile-resolution mp4, and no raw frame data
sits in RAM. BackgroundVideoCache (background_video_cache.py) subclasses this
as a single instance that is both the builder and the only consumer, with the
build interleaved with playback ticks.

KeyVideoCache below uses the same discipline differently. The module-level
registry shares the cache file across consumers. Exactly one detached builder
thread per md5, size and saturation decodes the source and encodes the tile
mp4 independently of playback ticks. Every consumer of acquire() gets its own
KeyVideoCache reader with its own cv2.VideoCapture and its own last-frame
memo. A reader decodes straight from the source until the builder promotes,
then switches over.
