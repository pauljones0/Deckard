    The key is the frame identity: video md5, frame index, key index,
    rotation, quality and native format. It is not the composited pixels. A
    bare key over a video background composites to the shared background tile.
    Its native bytes are therefore a pure function of that tuple, and the tile
    needs no serialization and no hash. A looping video pays its encodes on the
    first playthrough, and every later loop is a dict lookup.

    This class keeps ByteLRUCache's default first-sighting admission and adds
    no doorkeeper. EncodedImageCache's doorkeeper protects a pixel-hash
    namespace where high-entropy content produces keys that never repeat.
    Identity keys come from a finite, repeating space: the frames times the
    keys of the loaded video. First-sighting admission therefore makes the
    second loop encode-free, and the byte cap bounds it.

    Keep this separate from encode_memo. In one shared key space the two kinds
    of key collide, and the two need independent sizing.
