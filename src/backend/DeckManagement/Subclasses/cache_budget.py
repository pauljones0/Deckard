Process-wide budget for the native-image caches.

Each deck's encode_memo and native_tile_cache carries its own byte cap, but
nothing caps their sum. Total image-cache RAM then scales with deck count, and
eviction stays per-silo, so a cold deck's full memo yields no byte to a hot one
however hard the hot one thrashes. This module adds the aggregate, a ceiling
over the sum of the evictable caches and a cross-cache LRU that sheds from
whichever cache owns the globally-oldest entry.

The overshoot bound
    Enforcement is deferred, so the ceiling does not bound the sum at every
    instant. The real bound is

        ceiling + (put rate x wake latency)

    Painters keep putting between the put that crosses the ceiling and the
    scheduling of the daemon. A painter can complete a whole tick of up to
    key-count puts in that window. Native key JPEGs run about 5-20 KiB, and
    the growing put fires the notify itself, so the window is one scheduler
    latency plus the damping interval and not the 60 s periodic pass. That is
    KBs to low MBs in practice. Once puts stop, the steady state settles at or
    below the ceiling. Strict synchronous enforcement is rejected, because it
    puts cross-cache work on the sole device writer's thread.

When it does nothing
    A ceiling of 0 disables global eviction (see ceiling_bytes), a malformed
    ceiling degrades to the default (see ceiling_bytes), and degenerate
    pressure stops the pass (see _warn_degenerate). In all three the sum of
    the local caps still bounds the total.
