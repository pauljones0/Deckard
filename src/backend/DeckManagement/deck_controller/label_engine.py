The composition engine turns a page's and an action's declared styling into
the pixels of one input. LabelManager owns the labels: defaults injection,
the epoch-stamped memos, the scroll state, and the blit recorder that keeps
a static label off FreeType on every frame. LayoutManager owns the
foreground, and BackgroundManager the colour behind both. Each one merges a
page layer with an action layer, caches the merge, and notifies the UI port.
This module imports nothing from its sibling modules in the package.

        A static label's pixels are a pure function of the text, the font,
        the colors, the outline, the alignment and the image geometry. None
        of those change between media ticks. A per-frame draw.text()
        re-rasterizes the stroked glyph run at ~820us per key, ~50% of the
        whole tick on a populated page over an animated background. This
        records the rasterization once, through _BitmapRecorder standing in
        for the draw core, and a later frame replays only the mask blits at
        ~11us.

        The replay issues the identical C blits, with the identical masks,
        inks and absolute coordinates that draw.text() issues, in the same
        order. So this path is exact for any ink and needs no
        semi-transparent carve-out, unlike the scroll strip. A precomposed
        RGBA strip cannot be exact here. Where a partly covered fill pixel
        overdraws a partly covered stroke pixel, the strip collapses two
        coverage blends into one straight-alpha value, measured up to 19/255
        off a direct draw.

        past the width cap or past the retention and op budget, and if PIL's
        text() stops routing through draw_bitmap.

        The non-RGB and non-RGBA guard keeps behavior parity, not a working
        fallback. The recorded ink resolves for the target mode, a palette
        index for "P" and a packed int for "RGB" and "RGBA", so a recording
        is valid only on the mode that took it. An "L" target raises, because

        records the mask blits, and return them. None means not recordable,
        so the caller draws directly.

        The probe target matches the real image's mode, because the ink
        resolves for the mode. It matches the real size because the probe is
        also the interception tripwire. A recording is safe to replay only if
        the recorder saw the whole draw, and a blank probe is the proof.
        Anything text() writes through another channel lands on this probe as
        residue, and only a full-size probe still shows it. PIL's
        embedded-color route pastes onto the target image directly and
        bypasses the draw core. A 1x1 probe records the identical ops,
        because text() derives the blit coordinates from xy, anchor and mask
        rather than from the canvas. That probe still clips every escaped
        write away, and it blinds this check.

        So the bar is non-empty ops and a blank probe. An empty ops list
        alone catches total loss only. A stroke pass that records while the
        fill pass escapes would cache an outline-only label forever.

        Residue detection is one-sided, because black ink on an "RGB" probe
        is invisible to getbbox(), so it can never reject a good recording,
        only miss a bad one. Every in-app label target is RGBA, where escaped
        ink moves the alpha channel off zero."""
