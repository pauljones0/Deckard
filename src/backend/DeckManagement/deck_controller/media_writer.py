The media writer runs one MediaPlayerThread per deck, plus the units it
executes. That thread is the sole writer to its device. Every key image,
touchscreen image, brightness change and blank reaches the hardware from
inside its loop, so this module decides the ordering between them. A paint
carries the page and generation it was rendered for, and the write boundary
judges it stale. A control message, for brightness, clear, clear-and-close
or a stashed-input release, has no page affinity, drains first on every
wake, and always executes, FIFO.

This module also holds the native JPEG encoders that every paint funnels
through, and the FIFO transport lock that stops a write burst from starving
the device's HID read poll. The paint protocol is the one sibling module it
imports; nothing else in the deck_controller package reaches it.
