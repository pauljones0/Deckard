One DeckController per physical deck, plus the table that maps an identifier
type to the controller-input class that drives it.

A controller owns the device handle and everything hung off it, and it owns
the lifecycle. It opens the deck with its transport lock already FIFO,
builds the inputs, starts the media writer, loads a page, and tears all of
that down in a fixed order at close(). It writes nothing to the device
itself. An input composes every paint and enqueues it for the media writer,
which is the sole writer.

Page loading is the busiest seam. load_page() serializes switches under
_load_page_lock, then bumps _page_load_generation and stamps every input
with the new generation inside one hold of _page_gen_lock. A paint queued
from another thread then carries the generation it was rendered for, and the
write boundary judges it against the present one. The writer reads that same
pair, and the screensaver bumps it too, because it swaps this object's
inputs and background out and puts them back on hide().

This module imports the media writer, the background media group and the
inputs, and none of them imports it back.
