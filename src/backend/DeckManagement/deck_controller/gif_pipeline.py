draws a deck or strip canvas; KeyGIF draws one key. This module imports

class KeyGIF(SingleKeyAsset):
    """Animated-GIF provider for one key, playing its own per-frame delay
    timeline.

    It holds its frames one of two ways. An opaque GIF uses the shared mp4
    tile registry: one refcounted cache file per (source, size, saturation),
    and one decoded frame in hand. RAM is then O(1) per key instead of
    O(frame count). A 200-frame GIF costs ~29MB retained, and a page of them
    ~0.9GiB.
    An alpha-carrying GIF uses the retained RGBA frame list, the only form
    that keeps transparency, because an mp4 has no alpha channel.

    Two rules make the split safe. PIL is the only compositor. The tile mp4
    is therefore written from PIL-composited frames, and FFmpeg never demuxes
    a GIF here. FFmpeg disagrees with PIL on disposal and partial-extent
    frames (7 of 15 frames on a stock test file, ~48% of pixels off). The
    route follows the rendered alpha, not the header declaration. 75% of real
    GIFs declare a transparent index and 11% ever render one, so the
    declaration left ~64% of GIFs on the expensive path.

    The classification costs one PIL walk the first time a GIF appears at a
    given size, plus an alpha extrema pass and, for an opaque GIF, one
    encode. After that the artifact on disk is the classification, and a warm
    construction walks the delays only, attaches a reader, and decodes no
    pixel.

    With performance.cache-videos off there is no disk cache to route to, so
    every GIF stays on the frame list and no GIF reaches the registry.

    Either way the timeline is PIL's, from wall-clock picking over the
    cumulative per-frame delays, so an irregular GIF plays at its own rhythm
    instead of
    a constant fps. On the video route the picked index goes to the reader
    instead of a list subscript, with identical arithmetic."""

        zero frames and returns before it asks a released reader for pixels.
