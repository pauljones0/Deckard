# FIFO ticket lock. It serves as the Stream Deck per-device transport mutex.
# CPython's threading.Lock is unfair. A thread that releases and immediately
# re-acquires beats a waiter parked for milliseconds, so an unpaced write
# burst out-races the library's HID read poll on this shared per-device
# mutex. Input events then arrive coalesced and dials lag. Ticket order
# bounds the reader's wait at the chunk in flight plus the chunks queued
# ahead of it. The writer queues one chunk at a time, so that bound is
# single-digit milliseconds.
#
# This lock is not reentrant, because the transport takes it for one chunk
# operation at a time. A re-entering holder queues behind itself and
# deadlocks, as it does on the threading.Lock this stands in for.
