Central exception hooks.

A function decorated with @log.catch feeds its exceptions into loguru. An
uncaught exception on any other path reaches stderr alone, and a detached run
under autostart or flatpak loses it. install_exception_hooks() closes the four
surfaces that leak one, and _log_exc() rate-limits what they report.

Every hook routes through loguru, so a record reaches every sink that
config_logger() installed, which are logs/logs.log, stderr and the gl.logs
ring behind the About dialog. Loguru's default stderr sink catches a record
emitted before that call. Each hook resolves the sinks at call time, so no
re-install follows.

This module stays importable before globals, which the fixtures.py contract
of the test harness needs, so it imports stdlib and loguru only. log_redaction
is the one allowed sibling import, on the same contract, and
install_exception_hooks() installs its scrubbing patcher, so no hook routes an
unredacted traceback into a sink.

# One record per site per window, keyed by exception type and innermost

# failure elsewhere. A count that gets no next record is flushed rather than
# dropped, when the prune evicts its entry, when the process exits through
# atexit, and onto a terminal record. The guard may make a flood quiet, and
# never invisible.
#
# That key has a known bound. Two different failures raised from one line with
# one exception type, such as a raise ValueError(...) that several callers
# reach with different messages, share one budget and can mask each other for
# a window. The message stays out of the key, because a real message carries a
# varying id, path or counter, and a message-keyed guard then throttles
# nothing, which is the failure this guard prevents. The summary line
# therefore reads "N further failures at <site>" and never "N repeats",

def _scrub_fault_log(path: str) -> None:
    """Scrub the faulthandler dumps of earlier sessions, in place.

    faulthandler writes a dump at the C level, straight to the stored fd, so
    the dump still lands while the interpreter is wedged. The loguru redaction
    patcher therefore never sees it, and a traceback frame path such as
    File "/home/<user>/..." reaches disk raw. A live intercept would break the
    wedged-interpreter guarantee. This therefore scrubs the file at boot,
    right before the next boot marker appends. A reader opens this file after
    a restart. One known limitation stays. A dump written during the current
    session stays raw on disk until the next boot.

    This streams line by line, because a dump is line-oriented and every
    scrub() pattern fits one line, so a years-old multi-boot file cannot
    balloon memory. The scrubbed content goes to a unique mkstemp temp file in
    the same directory, and then copies back over the original in place. It
    must not use os.replace. A replace swaps the inode, which strands the
    registered faulthandler fd of every running instance on the unlinked old
    file. A booting secondary, and this runs before the single-instance gate,
    then redirects the primary's later crash and SIGQUIT dumps into a file
    that nothing finds. A same-inode rewrite keeps a live fd valid and leaves
    the mode and the ownership alone, because nothing re-creates the file. It
    costs one case. "r+" needs write permission, so this skips a log that
    somebody chmod'd read-only, and logs the warning below. os.replace instead
    swaps such a file.

    The flock does not block. On contention this skips the scrub, for two
    reasons. The only legitimate holder is another boot that scrubs this same
    file to the same result. A wait lets a wedged holder, under SIGSTOP or a
    stalled disk, block every later launch. The flock is advisory and excludes
    another scrubber only. A dump that another instance appends at the C level
    during the writeback window lands past the read snapshot and truncate()
    drops it. A replace instead loses the same dump to the unlinked inode and
    strands the fd for good. A scrub of faulthandler content is idempotent,
    because a frame path and a boot marker are fixed points, and scrub() is
    not idempotent in general. A second boot's scrub therefore changes no
    content, and the unchanged check below turns it into no write at all. The
    file is rewritten only when a line changed, so the partial-writeback
    window, from a crash or an ENOSPC mid-copy, opens only on a boot that had
    raw PII to redact. Any failure logs and returns, because a scrub problem
    must not block startup."""
