class StoreCache:
    """The files.json index and the on-disk blobs for downloaded store files.

    Each entry carries two clocks. "date" records the last use. Every open
    renews it, and remove_old_cache_files evicts an unused entry by it.
    "fetched" records the content age. A write stamps it only after the
    commit, and it bounds the stale fallback in
    StoreBackend.get_remote_file. A staleness bound on "date" would be
    circular, because serving the stale copy renews that clock.

    The index persists in two halves, split by the cost of a lost write. The
    two halves are not interchangeable.

    A content commit writes synchronously. _stamp_committed runs after a
    blob's os.replace lands, and remove_old_cache_files evicts, and both
    write files.json at once. A lost "path" or "fetched" stamp orphans the
    blob forever, because remove_old_cache_files walks index entries only, so
    no pass ages out a file with no entry and nothing finds it again. Crash
    safety demands this write, so it must not defer.

    A read-clock renewal defers. The read path, and the first sighting of a
    cache string, renew "date" in memory and mark the index dirty. One daemon
    timer flushes the whole index FLUSH_DEBOUNCE_S later. The first dirty
    mark arms that timer, and a later mark leaves the pending timer alone. A
    synchronous renewal would rewrite the whole files.json, with a json.dump
    of every entry and an fsync, once per catalog file opened. This costs one
    write per burst. A hard kill inside the window loses that much renewal,
    which makes an entry look FLUSH_DEBOUNCE_S older against a DAYS_TO_KEEP
    (3 day) eviction bound, and the next read renews it again.

    An entry mutation and the index write both run under write_lock. The
    hazard is not the top-level files.copy(), because dict.copy() is one
    atomic operation. files.copy() is shallow, so json.dump then iterates the
    same per-entry dicts that the read and commit paths mutate. A thread that
    adds "fetched" to an entry mid-dump raises "dictionary changed size
    during iteration", and can truncate the index to what atomic_write_json
    buffered. remove_old_cache_files is the one exception, and it pops
    entries without the lock. It runs from __init__ only, before another
    thread can reach the instance and before a flush timer can exist.
