"""The store's one typed error channel.

The fetch layer (request_from_url, get_remote_file, get_last_commit,
get_manifest, get_official_authors) raises StoreFetchError when it cannot
satisfy a fetch. The read boundary above it (get_all_*, the private
_get_assets_to_update) returns a StoreResult: an Ok that carries the payload,
or an Err that names the reason.

Ok holds the payload, so a caller must narrow the result before it iterates or
indexes it. A missed failure branch is then a type error, and an un-narrowed
Err raises TypeError at first use instead of reading as an empty list. Neither
arm defines __bool__. This module imports stdlib only, so any layer can name
these types.
