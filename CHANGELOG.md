# Changelog

Notable changes to this fork. Versions are the fork's own release line (root
`VERSION` file, `vX.Y.Z` tags), independent of upstream StreamController's
`app_version` in `globals.py`. Each release publishes an installable flatpak
bundle as a release asset.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- The plugin store follows a reviewed snapshot of the official catalog,
  pinned by this fork and moved deliberately after a diff review. The
  catalog had been frozen since 2026-08 on an old snapshot because it
  tracked upstream's per-app-version mapping; the four new plugins and the
  twenty-one plugin updates published since then are available again, and
  the store no longer depends on that mapping file at run time.
- Installing or updating a store asset now refuses a download whose manifest
  requires a newer app version. Such an install would replace a working
  plugin with one the app then refuses to load; the running plugin now stays
  in place instead.

### Security

- Installing a plugin from the store now asks before it runs the plugin's
  install steps, and runs them confined. A plugin can ship a setup step
  that runs on this computer at install time; one such step silently
  changed a system setting outside the app. The store now asks before
  running a plugin's install steps, and, where the bwrap sandbox tool is
  present, runs each step on a read-only system with access only to the
  plugin's own folder and no connection to the desktop session. Where
  bwrap is not available the step still runs, with the desktop session
  hidden from it as far as the environment allows; the prompt is the main
  protection there. A hung step is stopped instead of holding the install
  open, and declining an update keeps the working plugin in place. A new
  setting under Store, "Plugin install scripts" (ask, always or never),
  controls the prompt; the prompt appears for store installs, while an
  automatic update of a plugin you already installed runs its steps
  without asking unless you declined them before.
- Plugin backends now listen on the local machine only, and accept
  connections from the desktop session that started them. A plugin backend
  used to open a network port that any machine on the same network could
  reach, and anything running on the computer could connect to the app's
  plugin ports; a connection to one of those ports could run code as the
  user. The app now starts each backend on a loopback-only port, checks that
  a connecting program is the same user on the same machine, and refuses and
  shuts down a backend that is still reachable from the network.
- Importing pages now stays inside the pages directory. An imported file
  names its pages, and a page name that pointed at a location outside the
  pages folder used to send the write there and could overwrite an unrelated
  file. The import now keeps every write inside the pages folder and skips a
  page or a deck whose name points outside it, while a normal import lands as
  before.

### Fixed

- The plugin store reads both store catalog formats, the old per-version
  commit map and the new single-commit form, so a store that publishes the
  new format still lists, installs and updates its assets instead of showing
  an empty page. A store entry that names a branch now resolves that branch
  everywhere; a broken pin beside it no longer hides the entry from the
  store window while updates keep following the branch.
- The search box and the image and video buttons on the Custom Assets tab now
  filter what the grid shows, and the grid lists assets by name. The tab
  handed the grid its search filter and its sort order under names the grid
  already used for something else, so both were dropped: every custom asset
  stayed on screen, in storage order, whatever was typed or toggled.
- An icon pack, wallpaper pack or SD+ bar wallpaper pack whose manifest leaves
  out its asset folder no longer stops every pack of that kind from loading.
  One such pack used to fail the whole list, so the asset chooser showed none
  of them; now that pack alone is reported as unusable. A manifest that leaves
  out its thumbnail used to leave the chooser loading forever, and now loads
  the pack without a thumbnail.
- Tray menus now answer a host that asks for a single menu property. The
  property was looked up in the wrong place and the reply was built in the
  wrong shape, so the host got no reply at all and waited for its timeout.
- Onboarding no longer fails to report which recommended plugins could not be
  installed. A plugin whose store record carries no name put nothing in the
  list, and building the summary message then failed.
- A plugin's settings window now opens when one of the plugin's custom icons
  has had its image file deleted. The window failed to build at all, so none
  of that plugin's settings could be reached.
- The info button on an icon inside an icon pack now works when the pack
  ships no attribution for that icon. The dialog failed to open instead.
- Reverting a background colour no longer leaves the colour picker unable to
  save. A failure part-way through the revert used to disconnect the row's
  signals and never reconnect them, so later colour changes on that row were
  quietly dropped.
- The deck pickers in the page editor now open when one deck cannot be
  identified. A deck whose serial number could not be read used to stop the
  whole list from building, so neither the default-page row nor the
  auto-change row could pick a deck.
- Changing a page's brightness, background or screensaver override now
  reaches every connected deck. A deck that had not loaded a page yet used to
  stop the update, so any deck listed after it kept the old setting until the
  next page load.
- Opening the details of a store icon pack, wallpaper or SD+ bar wallpaper no
  longer fails when the asset carries translated licence descriptions. The
  details panel raised an error and stayed on the previous asset's values;
  now it shows the description for the active language.
- The About dialog of a plugin now opens when the plugin's manifest omits its
  name, version or repository. It used to fail silently and show nothing.
- Editing or resetting a custom plugin icon whose image file has since been
  deleted no longer fails. The icon editor now reports that there is no image
  behind the entry instead of doing nothing.
- The store no longer marks an icon pack or wallpaper as installed when its
  download actually failed. An install button used to flip to "installed" over
  a pack that a 404, a rejected file, or an unreachable store had never
  written; now a failed install leaves the button as it was and reports the
  failure, so it can be retried.
- Installing a plugin from a missing-action row or from the onboarding
  recommendations no longer hangs when the store cannot be reached. The button
  used to spin forever on its "installing" label with no way back; now an
  unreachable store surfaces the same install-failed state as any other
  failure, and the row can be retried.
- Screensaver and brightness settings now show the values the deck actually
  uses. A page's screensaver brightness slider read 75 for a screensaver that
  had never been given one, while the deck dimmed to 30; a deck's own settings
  page offered 50 as the brightness for a deck that was running at 75. Decks
  that already have these values chosen keep them exactly as they are.
- Opening a deck's settings no longer changes or rewrites its configuration.
  The page used to fill in every setting the deck had never been given and
  save the result — which, for brightness, also dimmed the deck on the spot,
  and froze that day's defaults into the deck's configuration so that later
  improvements to them never reached it.
- Deck-level background media without an explicit loop setting now loops,
  instead of playing once and holding its last frame for as long as the page
  is up. Page-level background media is unchanged: it still plays once by
  default.
- A deck plugged in while the session is locked now shows the screensaver it
  is configured with, at the brightness it is configured with, instead of a
  blank panel at a brightness nothing had chosen.
- Opening the settings of a deck that has been rotated no longer re-saves and
  re-applies that rotation, with the full page reload that comes with it.
- Selecting pages in the page manager no longer makes the page editor's
  screensaver brightness slider write its own displayed value back to each
  page it visits, and reapply it to the deck.
- A plugin whose settings file cannot be read no longer breaks that plugin's
  settings window. Choosing an icon or a colour there failed outright when the
  file was present but unreadable — a permissions change, a disconnected drive
  — instead of treating it as empty the way every other read of that file
  already did.
- Changing a default font in the settings window no longer reverts other
  general settings that changed while that window was open. The font was
  saved correctly, and then the window's picture of the settings file — taken
  when it opened — was written on top of it, putting back the hold time and
  the rest as they had been at that moment.
- A deck plugged in after Deckard has started now appears on the D-Bus
  interface, and a deck that is unplugged disappears from it. Only the decks
  present at launch were ever published, so scripts driving Deckard over
  D-Bus could not see a deck plugged in later — including the common case of
  starting with the session, before the deck is ready — while a deck that had
  been removed stayed on the interface, still answering calls.
- The active page name a deck reports over D-Bus is now correct from the
  moment it appears there, instead of reading empty until something changed
  the page.
- Asking a deck over the D-Bus interface to show the page it is already
  showing now does nothing, instead of reloading the deck. Scripts that set a
  page on every event — a window rule, a home-automation trigger — made the
  deck re-render all of its keys each time.
- Every `--change-page` and `--change-state` on one command line now takes
  effect. When Deckard was already running, only the first request was sent to
  it: a command carrying several page changes moved one deck and left the
  others alone, and any state change on a command that also changed a page was
  dropped entirely.
- `--change-page` and `--change-state` now report failures in the terminal you
  typed them in, and exit non-zero, instead of leaving the reason in the
  running instance's log where nothing showed it to you. Requests are also no
  longer pre-rejected against limits the CLI invented (coordinates above 10,
  states above 20): a large deck's real coordinates and state numbers now
  reach the running instance, which checks them against the device itself.
- A page that cannot be loaded no longer blanks the deck while reporting
  success. Asking for a page whose file is present but unusable cleared every
  key and said the switch had worked; the deck now keeps the page it was
  showing and the request explains itself.
- Switching to a page while several pages are already cached no longer lands
  you on a dead one. With enough pages open the app could discard a page in
  the moment between picking it and showing it, leaving a deck whose keys
  looked right but did nothing until the page was loaded again — and leaving
  a second, competing copy of that page behind.
- Page edits made in different places at the same time no longer overwrite
  each other. Changing a page's settings — a screensaver, brightness,
  background or window-rule override — while a plugin or a key edit was
  saving the same page could silently drop one of the two changes, from the
  file and from the running app, so a setting you had just made would be back
  to its old value the next time you looked.
- Window-based automatic page switching now works on desktops that report a
  colon-joined `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP`, such as `ubuntu:GNOME` — window
  grabbing matched only single-name desktops and stayed silently disabled
  everywhere else.
- An idle deck showing the screensaver no longer repaints every key, dial and
  touchscreen once a second; a still screensaver now costs no per-second work
  at all. Recovering the picture after a dropped device write is handled by
  the existing repaint retry instead, which also covers a rare blank deck on
  screensaver entry that the per-second repaint had been masking.
- A deck that fails to connect no longer leaves background work running for
  the rest of the session. Every failed attempt — a deck whose USB link flakes
  while the session is starting, or one already claimed by another instance —
  stranded the threads that had been started for it, including one still
  trying to draw to the deck it never got. Repeated attempts piled them up, so
  a deck that would not come up cost idle CPU and memory until Deckard was
  restarted.
- Launching Deckard while it is still starting up now waits for that startup
  and brings the window up when it finishes, instead of giving up after ten
  seconds and exiting with an error — which also lost a `--change-page` sent
  in that window. A startup slower than the session bus's own call timeout
  still outlasts the wait.
- A page or state change given to a launch that lost the startup race is no
  longer dropped. Two launches at the same moment leave one of them handing
  over to the other, and the requests it had already taken went with it —
  nothing applied, nothing said, and a successful exit code.
- The message shown when the running Deckard does not answer `--change-page`
  or `--change-state` now names what it can actually mean. It offered a
  startup that had not finished as the likely explanation, which stopped being
  possible when the app started publishing its interface before taking its bus
  name; it now names the two things that remain — an older build, and an
  instance that is shutting down — with what to do about each.
- The list of controllers on the D-Bus interface now matches the objects a
  client can address. It was read from the decks the app had, so during the
  moment between a deck being added and its object appearing it named a deck
  whose object was not there yet — and a client that composed a path from that
  list got an error for a deck that was plainly plugged in.
- Asking to change a page on a deck when none are connected now says that the
  app may still be starting, rather than only that nothing is connected: the
  interface answers from the moment Deckard takes its bus name, which is
  before it has opened any deck.
- A damaged custom-asset library file no longer prevents Deckard from
  starting. It was read while the app was still building itself, so an
  unreadable one stopped the app before any window appeared, with nothing on
  screen to say why. Deckard now starts with an empty custom-asset library and
  says so in the log; the damaged file is renamed aside and kept next to the
  new empty one, so nothing is thrown away, and the asset files themselves are
  untouched.
- Importing a StreamDeck UI profile now updates the deck settings the rest of
  the app is reading. The import wrote its brightness and screensaver
  preferences straight to the file, so anything that had already read that
  deck — the deck itself included — could go on showing the settings from
  before the import until something else caused them to be read again.
- The AUR package no longer ships development files under `/opt/deckard`. A
  built package could carry linter caches picked up from the build directory,
  along with CI configuration, devcontainer files, and the packaging recipe
  itself; the installed tree now holds only the application and its bundled
  environment.

### Changed

- A second launch now hands off to the running Deckard through the application
  framework itself, instead of the app deciding for itself whether one was
  already running. Two launches starting at the same moment — a session
  autostart alongside a restored session — can no longer both reach the decks.
- `--close-running` that does not manage to close the running Deckard now
  exits with an error instead of reporting success, and it waits for the
  instance to actually let go rather than for a fixed five seconds. Against an
  instance that is itself still starting up it waits until that instance can
  answer before asking it to quit, so the two can no longer leave you with
  nothing running at all.
- Dragging a key onto another position now changes the page in one step. The
  two keys used to be exchanged one at a time with a save around each stage,
  so the page file was written three times for one drag and a write landing
  mid-swap could put one key's actions under both positions until the next
  save corrected it. Choosing an icon for a key no longer saves the page a
  second time on top of the save that setting it already made.
- Page edits are written in the background about a second after the last
  change, instead of once per keystroke. Typing a label used to write the
  whole page file — with two disk syncs — for every character, on the same
  thread that draws the window. The page is still written immediately when
  you switch page, close a deck or quit the app, and whenever anything reads
  the file, so what you see and what is exported or backed up is always
  current. The trade: a crash or power cut can now cost the last second of
  edits — up to five while you are typing continuously — where before it
  could cost none.
- The active window is no longer watched in the background unless a page
  actually uses a window auto-change rule. Previously every session polled
  the foreground window continuously — several helper processes a second on
  X11 and KDE — whether or not any page asked for it. The watcher now starts
  the moment the first rule is enabled and stops when the last one is removed.
  Consequently the D-Bus `ForegroundWindow` property now tracks the desktop
  only while window rules are in use; it can still be set from outside at any
  time via `NotifyForegroundWindow`.
- Startup is faster and much quieter on the network: the automatic store
  update check now reads the store catalogue plus what is already installed,
  instead of downloading a thumbnail, a manifest and an attribution file for
  every asset in the store — including the ones you never installed. Opening
  the store window still loads the full listing with images.
- Log files are now pruned automatically (the ten most recent rotations are
  kept) and default verbosity is lower — files record debug level and up, the
  console info and up. Set `SC_LOG_TRACE=1` to restore full trace logging on
  every sink for diagnosis.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-08-09

### Fixed

- Remote decks no longer misreport touch capability; touchscreen strip frames
  are no longer rendered and encoded for decks that cannot display them.
- Window grabbing survives an unset `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP` on X11 — previously
  a startup crash left it silently disabled for the whole session.
- Importing a StreamDeck-UI profile now rejects hotkeys carrying delay tokens
  with a clear message instead of silently dropping the whole hotkey.
- Outdated-action rows in the sidebar render again instead of failing on
  construction.
- Unplugging a deck mid-render no longer crashes the media tick on image-size
  lookups, and media loads skip cleanly when a deck closes during page load.
- Store items with missing or corrupt manifests are dropped with a log line
  instead of crashing catalog preparation workers, and downloads without a
  resolvable ref fail up front instead of staging junk.
- Notifications, plugin installs and DBus page/state changes degrade
  gracefully during startup and teardown instead of raising inside idle
  callbacks.

### Changed

- The entire tree now type-checks clean under mypy and the CI type-check lane
  is a blocking gate; roughly fifty latent defects surfaced by the typing work
  were fixed along the way.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-09

### Fixed

- Mutable default arguments across 8 sites, two of them on the plugin-facing
  API (`ActionHolder.action_support`, `ActionCore.set_background_color`): the
  shared default object leaked mutations between unrelated callers for the
  lifetime of the process.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- First Deckard release: an installable flatpak bundle is built and published
  as a release asset on every `vX.Y.Z` tag.
- Native Arch-family package (`deckard-git`) for the AUR, alongside the flatpak.
- Native installs run as the `deckard` command and store their data under
  `$XDG_DATA_HOME/deckard` (`~/.local/share/deckard`), migrated automatically
  from the previous `~/.var/app` location.
- About dialog shows the Deckard fork release version (from the `VERSION`
  file); the upstream StreamController base is noted in the About comments.
