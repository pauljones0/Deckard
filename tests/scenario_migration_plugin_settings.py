"""
Regression scenario for Migrator_1_5_0_beta_5.migrate_plugin_settings.

The migrator writes each plugin's settings.json to the new path before it
removes the old file. The write is atomic. The migrator never clobbers
settings that already sit at the new path. A re-run after a crash finishes
the remainder.
