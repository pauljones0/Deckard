Regression test for uncapped touchscreen writes.

Every touchscreen write is rate-capped at the write point in
perform_media_player_tasks, on the shared _video_write_hz budget with
latest-wins semantics.
"""

# Without that cap, a back-to-back write flood out-races the 20Hz HID read
# poll on the transport's single mutex and starves input. An over-budget frame
# goes back into the single task slot, so content is delayed by at most one
# budget window and never lost.
